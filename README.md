# Angular App with Web Components

A concept of an app built with Angular and Web Components, with possibilities to query and manipulate data, and works totally offline.

You can try the [online demo](https://amahdy.github.io/angular-webcomponent/), and you can also [reset the local modifications](https://amahdy.github.io/angular-webcomponent/?resetdemo) at anytime.
